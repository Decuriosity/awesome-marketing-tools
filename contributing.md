- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Guidelines for adding tools

- The tool should be widely used or recognized in the marketing industry.
- Free and open-source tools are preferred, but high-quality commercial tools are also welcome.
- The tool should have a clear focus on marketing or a specific aspect of marketing.
- Avoid adding tools that are too niche or have limited use cases.
- Ensure the tool is actively maintained and has recent updates.

## Removing tools

If you find a tool that should be removed from the list (e.g., it's no longer maintained, has been deprecated, or doesn't meet the quality standards), please open an issue or submit a pull request with a brief explanation.

Thank you for your suggestions!
